# Diamond Pattern

This repository features a **Diamond Pattern** implemented in Java, showcasing structured problem-solving and logic-building skills.

## Pattern Output
```
    *    
   ***   
  *****  
 *******  
*********  
 *******  
  *****  
   ***   
    *  
```

## About the Pattern
- **Symmetrical Structure**: The pattern consists of an upper and lower pyramid.
- **Centered Alignment**: The stars (`*`) are positioned to form a **diamond shape**.
- **Increment & Decrement Logic**: The number of stars increases in the first half and decreases in the second half.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```
3. **Compile and Run the Java Program**:
   ```bash
   javac DiamondPattern.java
   java DiamondPattern
   ```

## Why This Pattern?
This pattern helps in:
- Strengthening **nested loop** concepts.
- Enhancing **logical and spatial reasoning**.
- Practicing **conditional statements** effectively.
