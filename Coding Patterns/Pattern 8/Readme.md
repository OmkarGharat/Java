# Number Pattern

This repository contains a unique number pattern implemented in Java, demonstrating logical thinking and problem-solving skills. The pattern follows a **sequential numbering approach** forming a triangular structure:

```
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
```

## About the Pattern
- **Incremental Numbering**: Numbers increase sequentially across rows.
- **Row-wise Growth**: Each row contains one more number than the previous row.
- **Triangular Structure**: Forms a structured pattern commonly used in logic-building exercises.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```
3. **Compile and Run the Java Program**:
   ```bash
   javac Pattern.java
   java Pattern
   ```

## Why This Pattern?
This pattern helps in:
- Enhancing **problem-solving abilities**.
- Strengthening **loops and nested loops** understanding.
- Improving **logical thinking and algorithm development**.
