# Palindromic Number Pattern

This repository contains a Java implementation of a **palindromic number pattern**, showcasing logic-building skills and problem-solving abilities.

## Pattern Output
```
    1   
  121  
 12321
1234321
 12321
  121  
   1   
```

## About the Pattern
- **Symmetric Structure**: Forms a **palindromic** pattern with numbers.
- **Increment & Decrement**: Numbers increase towards the center and mirror back.
- **Centered Formatting**: The pattern aligns symmetrically around the middle column.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```
3. **Compile and Run the Java Program**:
   ```bash
   javac PalindromicPattern.java
   java PalindromicPattern
   ```

## Why This Pattern?
This pattern is useful for:
- Strengthening **nested loops** and **string manipulation logic**.
- Enhancing **pattern-based problem-solving** skills.
- Practicing **mirroring techniques in number patterns**.
