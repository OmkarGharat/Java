# Star Pattern

This repository features an interesting **star pattern** implemented in Java, showcasing problem-solving skills and logical thinking. The pattern follows a **diamond-like structure** with incremental and decremental growth:

```
  *
 **
***
****
*****
****
***
**
*
```

## About the Pattern
- **Increasing & Decreasing Pattern**: Forms a **symmetric structure** with a peak at the center.
- **Loop-Based Logic**: Uses nested loops to control the number of stars per row.
- **Common in Programming Challenges**: This pattern is frequently asked in coding interviews and competitive programming.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```
3. **Compile and Run the Java Program**:
   ```bash
   javac StarPattern.java
   java StarPattern
   ```

## Why This Pattern?
This pattern helps in:
- Understanding **nested loops and iteration logic**.
- Improving **algorithmic thinking and problem-solving**.
- Strengthening **control flow concepts in programming**.
