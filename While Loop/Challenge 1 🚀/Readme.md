# ðŸ“Œ User Input Validator

## Description
The goal of this program is to prompt the user for a valid number between 1 and 100. 

## Functionality
- If the user enters an invalid number (e.g., 0, -5, 101, NaN), the program will ask the user to input a valid number again.
- The loop will continue until the user provides a valid number within the specified range (1 to 100).

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user to input a number.
2. If the input is not a valid number within the specified range (1-100), it will prompt the user to enter the number again.
3. This process continues until the user inputs a valid number.
